 -- To create a sum and calculate the eigenvector of relationships between types, you can utilize graph-based algorithms. Here's an outline of the steps involved:
-- u
-- 1. Define a directed graph where the types are represented as nodes, and the relationships between types are represented as edges.

-- 2. Assign weights to the edges based on the relationships between the types. For example, you can use the number of shared constructors or other criteria to determine the weight.

-- 3. Apply a graph algorithm such as the PageRank algorithm, which calculates the eigenvector centrality of each node in the graph. The eigenvector centrality represents the importance or influence of a node based on its connections to other nodes.

-- 4. Retrieve the eigenvector values and identify the type with the highest value, indicating its prominence in the relationships.

-- Here's an example of how you can incorporate these steps into the existing code:
