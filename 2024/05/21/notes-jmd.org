The meta meme compiler and meme doctor agent would create logical propositions about memes as new memes or parts of memes
in the meme lab, much like a geneticist does.
Sequences of meme source code and behaviours would be recorded and analysed.
bioinformatics and semiotics and scientific methods can be used and duplicated.
deep graph knowledge embedding and llm models and alphago.
it can translate itself into other blockchains and mine them or purchase them
to be able to publish data on the network.
cost of bytes per blockchain cost record. per storage system.
each project or each dataset can be a new linked resource.
each sample can be thought of as a new data object in some dataset.
a rdf chain or linked data chain must exists.
