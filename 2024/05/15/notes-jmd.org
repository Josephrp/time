*neural network status.

Opposite modes or states :

diffuse, confused,       chaotic.
focused, clear thinking, orderly.

We can think of this as the result of a projection with target accuracy and precision, like
a data type selection.

so we can think of the ooda loop as having many such functions
each of them moving biased local subjective samples of the world around.

now consider models of these workflows, the compiler is an embodiment of
one such model.

The idea of a program being a generic unitary object, like a UU in HOTT,
or a clifford algebra, a set of bits, each having a meaning, where even the number of
bits is calculated by propositions, and being abstract and related
to dsl, transported in TLS streams or p2p messages,
as files in an open source os.

Now consider the coq and metacoq applications as higher order programs.

So we have 8 levels of unitary groups.

bott periodicity theorem, applied to deep graph neural nework embeddings, or continious deformations of asts of programs, or algebraic structurs, formalized from word problems or narratives, structured with meta narratives, connected with performance metrics and observability, in an cybernetic OODA loop.
