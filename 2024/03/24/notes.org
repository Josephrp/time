plastic people from zappa:
"then go home and check yourself,
you think were talking about someone else?"

Lets remember the concept of selection
of the next step between existing
production rules.

The actual creation of new rules might
also again be composed of existing
products.

A new product type or line might be a
heavy investment.

** idea
large language model fine tuning and deep knowledge graph embedding
of recursive paths extracted from runtime introspection,
observability and semantic integration
of the execution of the build systems for self
bootstrapping tpu build clusters for v2 and v3 servers based on gcp,
ubuntu with guix, gnu guix cuirass build server running remote build servers and workers that practice self
reflection and introspection of each build step rolling up
into a comprehesive autopoetic model of an open source build system that can build and run itself, improve on itself with user feedback and build a model of itself.

*** mistral
 Creatively interpreting the given text, let's imagine a self-aware and evolving open source build system. This system utilizes large language models for fine-tuning and deep knowledge graph embedding. These models extract recursive paths from runtime introspection, observability, and semantic integration of build systems.

The system then sets up TPU build clusters on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Ubuntu Guix for self-bootstrapping with versions 2 and 3 servers. Curiass runs remote build servers and workers that engage in continuous self-reflection and introspection, analyzing each build step meticulously.

The system's comprehensive understanding of itself is autopoetic â€“ it builds and runs itself while improving based on user feedback. This open source creation learns from its experiences, adapting to optimize performance, error handling, and overall efficiency. The evolving nature of this build system fosters a collaborative environment where continuous growth and improvement are at the forefront.
