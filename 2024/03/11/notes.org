The meta-narrative is one of just another kind of specialized form of
a narrative that we can construct or artificially synthesize on the fly.
the meta-narrative can represent beyond (the literal meaning of meta)
or more than the narrative
in it's creation it could be the meta data about the narrative
or the supposed state of the universe around that narrative,
its creation and reception in total, its impact, its extension.
the subsequent memes derived from it, its legacy.
the heros journey as a gamification.
the meta narrative as a set of models, deep graph embedding and executable proofs,
expert systems. 
it can represents a transformation.
we can look at meta-narrative as a new narrative
and meta data about the narrative, so the meta of the narrative, how it lives
and that is not another narrative.
