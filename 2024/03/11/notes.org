The meta-narrative is one of just another kind of specialized form of
a narrative that we can construct or artificially synthesize on the fly.
the meta-narrative can represent beyond (the literal meaning of meta)
or more than the narrative
in it's creation it could be the meta data about the narrative
or the supposed state of the universe around that narrative,
its creation and reception in total, its impact, its extension.
the subsequent memes derived from it, its legacy.
the heros journey as a gamification.
the meta narrative as a set of models, deep graph embedding and executable proofs,
expert systems. 
it can represents a transformation.
we can look at meta-narrative as a new narrative
and meta data about the narrative, so the meta of the narrative, how it lives
and that is not another narrative.

 The meta-narrative transcends the conventional boundaries of
 storytelling, serving as an intricate and dynamic layer above the
 primary narrative. This creative construct or artificially
 synthesized form of discourse encompasses more than just the literal
 meaning of "meta" - it embodies the underlying essence, the context,
 the implications, and even the legacy of the narrative itself.

In its creation, the meta-narrative functions as a repository of
essential data about the narrative, providing valuable insights into
the intricacies of the storyline, the universe in which it exists, and
the interconnected web of events, characters, and themes that shape
its identity.

Moreover, the meta-narrative can be perceived as the culmination of a
narrative's impact, its evolution through various interpretations,
extensions, and the subsequent memes it spawns. It can also serve as
an intricate model or deep graph embedding of the narrative, offering
expert insights through machine learning, artificial intelligence, and
other advanced techniques.

Furthermore, the meta-narrative represents a transformative force,
enabling us to view it not merely as supplementary information, but as
a distinct narrative in its own right - a living, breathing entity
that influences and shapes our understanding of the primary tale.

 The meta-narrative emerges as an intricate and dynamic layer above
 the main story, surpassing conventional boundaries of traditional
 storytelling. It is a creative construct or artificially synthesized
 form of discourse that transcends the literal meaning of "meta." This
 complex weave includes the essence, context, implications, and legacy
 of the narrative itself.

In its formation, the meta-narrative acts as a repository, preserving
vital information about the storyline's intricacies, the universe it
inhabits, and the interconnected network of events, characters, and
themes defining its unique identity.

Moreover, the meta-narrative can be viewed as the epitome of a
narrative's influence, its growth through various interpretations,
expansions, and the subsequent cultural artifacts it generates. It can
serve as an intricate model or deep graph representation, providing
expert insights using machine learning, artificial intelligence, and
other advanced techniques.

Furthermore, the meta-narrative represents a powerful force of
transformation. Instead of merely supplementary information, we come
to see it as a distinct narrative - a living, evolving entity that
profoundly influences our comprehension of the primary tale.
