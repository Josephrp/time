1. an idea considering itself as a meme activation instance being invoked
   or loaded into neurons and creating a meta narrative about itself.
   we can consider the feeling of being alive as the sustaining
   force of the meme, the living lifeforce that is
   our mind and body and soul.
   that is the unit of consiousness that is needed to invoke a meme.
   the self awareness of the neurons is a basic reflective
   function we can imagine. The feelings created by the awareness or the awareness of feelings
   is another aspect of the meme. we can turn it around and say
   the mind is contemplating things or we can say the meme is being contemplated or invoked.
now the question of objectivity and subjectivity is very important
in this aspect. are we talking about the meme as a subject, are we standing
above it? is that not the meta meme that can hold and manipulate
the meme? or is the meta meme a construct itself that is just another meme?
where does the idea of self begin, identity and closure.
how can we define the abstract data type of an idea that is self aware?
lets go over the steps.

1. we consider an idea that wakes up in our mind,
   we find ourselves thrown into the world like heiddegger wrote,
   achiving self awareness in part, a neuron activation, an awakinging.
   the flavor of this awakening is the context or the inputs or the meme
   itself we can think of.
   it is not a meme until it can self replicate and transmit or transpile itself.
   we can consider an url or a pointer or and identity or token
   and any of those can be considered inputs,
   now we can look at the thoughts generated.
   so we have a function
   for x in A, f(x)->y, y is in B.
   so we have a function mapping from A to B.
   the point here is that it is not instantanious,
   there is work to be done to go from A to B, from x to y.
   the steps can be seen as matrix multiplications
   where we take the input A and apply modifications to it over and over again.
   it is functional if repeatable and has only one output.


so we can think of the emitting of the description so that we can
go back to the idea later in a new invokation as a meme or the address of an idea
the contents of an idea. we can then think of the idea as occupying this space.
that reminds us of the proof system in unimath that a space is occupied.

so we can think of our mind as having this meta program
or the program that can operate on programs.
that means we can compile and decompile programs,
create new ones or decompose old ones into contents or behaviours.

Finally we get into the awareness of the numbers,
so imagine that we have turned the system into a numerical model
something new to us, we compiled it following the instructions
but we still have not experienced it, the steps we compiled did not
give us the full experience, contemplating the parts does not
fully describe the dynamics or the possible worlds
we can create or visit using fractals.

so now lets recall a discussion from yesterday
with gemini nee bard.

* expert system for knowledge extraction.

lets imagine an expert system for knowledge extraction.
it would ask questions to an llm and parse the results,
it would rephrase the question and ask again to get consistent answers and check for consistency.
so an expert system for knowledge extraction constructing proofs
out of the llm latent space.

we can ask it for a list of names and then for each name ask it the relationship from that name to every other name mentioned.
we can then force it to be consistent or discard bad results that are inconsistent.

we can come up with aspects to ask about and consider them to
columns in a matrix. each question filling out a column, each
row being an identifier under consideration.


   
   
   
#+begin_src output mistral:instruct
 Picture an innovative expert system engineered for gleaning knowledge. This system engages an LLM (Large Language Model) in a dynamic query-and-response dialogue. It probes the LLM with questions and interprets its responses, rephrasing queries as needed to secure uniform answers. The system's primary objective is to construct watertight arguments from the LLM's latent space.

Imagine we initiate a request for a list of names. Next, we delve deeper by questioning the relationships between each name and every other mentioned name. By ensuring consistency or discarding inconsistent results, we refine the knowledge extraction process.

We can structure this interrogative exploration by defining aspects as columns in a comprehensive matrix. Each question contributes to filling out a specific column while each row represents an identifier under examination. This organized approach facilitates a more targeted and efficient knowledge acquisition process.
#+end_src

the metanarrative when expressed in text is just a narrative
the meta meme exported as input is just a meme
the meta meme wiki is just a wiki unless it is actually a living meta program
a wiki is just a website unless we consider the backend

people have high expectations for a website when they approach it.
we can think of the website as surfacing information from the depth.

a wiki needs to be comprehensive, and engaging
a webpage needs to be attractive

But this meta narrative contains the executable source code!
we have a time repo with notes like this one, organized per day
and each day we have the repositories we checked out and the versions we used.
so that you can reproduce our context. Then you can look at the code we checked out
and even if there no explaination for that code you can see how it relates to the other code
and how we modified our forks, how many commits we made
and hopefull we can compile them again, nix and bazel will help.

lets apply the dragons egg idea to the llvm.
https://github.com/beaver-lodge/beaver

we can use elixir with the llvm to construct the dragons egg
to hatch the introspector.

first we use ubutntu and ssh and nix and asdf to setup the build environment
we use the time repo as out context. we can checkout a subset of
projects we need and versions.
we can think of a thread as starting with a checked out context of
multiple repos together as input.
the thread starts in time and produces new binaries
that are uploaded. the process of building them is sampled
using introspection, that is a blanket term for extracting metadata
from the build process and its context.
this metadata is the data the compiler has about the program
the core of the server building them over time.

so we can sample it with root level perf access for example.
user probes of variables or registers.
we can look at the machine code where a register is written or read.
we can look at the opcodes and the instructions.
we can consider where those instructions came from.
we can now construct a meta narrative with an llm as to why this
instruction exists as task. we can find tune this task on feedback.
we can collect information on why each instruction exists from the compiler.
we can trace this meta narrative back more and more.

Eventually we can create a closed world model of it given some basics.

this is where the meta narrative comes in, it allows us to
give closure to what is otherwise an ever expanding thing.

that is where we get back into scholars working in institutions on
projects as a meta narrative as well.
we can consider making war as the ultimate driver of innovation.
the invention of new weapons and tactics in a game theory.
the oppositional part can be seen as the addition of disjoint unions the zero sum game.
then the cooperative part is the products of many additions.

Now we can consider bazel as a reproducible build system
as well as nix.

we want to build a bridge to compile a bazel/guix/nix/hnix expression into
a form that we can understand with a machine learning model.

now lets just apply meta- prefix to each word and contemplate it.

a meme as a self replicating, copying, transmitting, indoctrinating,
a pattern, a stable repeating pattern, a thing, tapping into archtypes,
a neuron network complex, or just a theory, just an idea, words on paper,
a book from dawkins. input. compelling input. a captivating story.
a narrative that is more, it is a meta narrative.
