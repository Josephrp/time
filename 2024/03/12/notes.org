1. an idea considering itself as a meme activation instance being invoked
   or loaded into neurons and creating a meta narrative about itself.
   we can consider the feeling of being alive as the sustaining
   force of the meme, the living lifeforce that is
   our mind and body and soul.
   that is the unit of consiousness that is needed to invoke a meme.
   the self awareness of the neurons is a basic reflective
   function we can imagine. The feelings created by the awareness or the awareness of feelings
   is another aspect of the meme. we can turn it around and say
   the mind is contemplating things or we can say the meme is being contemplated or invoked.
now the question of objectivity and subjectivity is very important
in this aspect. are we talking about the meme as a subject, are we standing
above it? is that not the meta meme that can hold and manipulate
the meme? or is the meta meme a construct itself that is just another meme?
where does the idea of self begin, identity and closure.
how can we define the abstract data type of an idea that is self aware?
lets go over the steps.

1. we consider an idea that wakes up in our mind,
   we find ourselves thrown into the world like heiddegger wrote,
   achiving self awareness in part, a neuron activation, an awakinging.
   the flavor of this awakening is the context or the inputs or the meme
   itself we can think of.
   it is not a meme until it can self replicate and transmit or transpile itself.
   we can consider an url or a pointer or and identity or token
   and any of those can be considered inputs,
   now we can look at the thoughts generated.
   so we have a function
   for x in A, f(x)->y, y is in B.
   so we have a function mapping from A to B.
   the point here is that it is not instantanious,
   there is work to be done to go from A to B, from x to y.
   the steps can be seen as matrix multiplications
   where we take the input A and apply modifications to it over and over again.
   it is functional if repeatable and has only one output.


so we can think of the emitting of the description so that we can
go back to the idea later in a new invokation as a meme or the address of an idea
the contents of an idea. we can then think of the idea as occupying this space.
that reminds us of the proof system in unimath that a space is occupied.

so we can think of our mind as having this meta program
or the program that can operate on programs.
that means we can compile and decompile programs,
create new ones or decompose old ones into contents or behaviours.

Finally we get into the awareness of the numbers,
so imagine that we have turned the system into a numerical model
something new to us, we compiled it following the instructions
but we still have not experienced it, the steps we compiled did not
give us the full experience, contemplating the parts does not
fully describe the dynamics or the possible worlds
we can create or visit using fractals.

so now lets recall a discussion from yesterday
with gemini nee bard.

* expert system for knowledge extraction.

lets imagine an expert system for knowledge extraction.
it would ask questions to an llm and parse the results,
it would rephrase the question and ask again to get consistent answers and check for consistency.
so an expert system for knowledge extraction constructing proofs
out of the llm latent space.

we can ask it for a list of names and then for each name ask it the relationship from that name to every other name mentioned.
we can then force it to be consistent or discard bad results that are inconsistent.

we can come up with aspects to ask about and consider them to
columns in a matrix. each question filling out a column, each
row being an identifier under consideration.


   
   
   
#+begin_src output mistral:instruct
 Picture an innovative expert system engineered for gleaning knowledge. This system engages an LLM (Large Language Model) in a dynamic query-and-response dialogue. It probes the LLM with questions and interprets its responses, rephrasing queries as needed to secure uniform answers. The system's primary objective is to construct watertight arguments from the LLM's latent space.

Imagine we initiate a request for a list of names. Next, we delve deeper by questioning the relationships between each name and every other mentioned name. By ensuring consistency or discarding inconsistent results, we refine the knowledge extraction process.

We can structure this interrogative exploration by defining aspects as columns in a comprehensive matrix. Each question contributes to filling out a specific column while each row represents an identifier under examination. This organized approach facilitates a more targeted and efficient knowledge acquisition process.
#+end_src

the metanarrative when expressed in text is just a narrative
the meta meme exported as input is just a meme
the meta meme wiki is just a wiki unless it is actually a living meta program
a wiki is just a website unless we consider the backend

people have high expectations for a website when they approach it.
we can think of the website as surfacing information from the depth.

a wiki needs to be comprehensive, and engaging
a webpage needs to be attractive

But this meta narrative contains the executable source code!
we have a time repo with notes like this one, organized per day
and each day we have the repositories we checked out and the versions we used.
so that you can reproduce our context. Then you can look at the code we checked out
and even if there no explaination for that code you can see how it relates to the other code
and how we modified our forks, how many commits we made
and hopefull we can compile them again, nix and bazel will help.

lets apply the dragons egg idea to the llvm.
https://github.com/beaver-lodge/beaver

we can use elixir with the llvm to construct the dragons egg
to hatch the introspector.

first we use ubutntu and ssh and nix and asdf to setup the build environment
we use the time repo as out context. we can checkout a subset of
projects we need and versions.
we can think of a thread as starting with a checked out context of
multiple repos together as input.
the thread starts in time and produces new binaries
that are uploaded. the process of building them is sampled
using introspection, that is a blanket term for extracting metadata
from the build process and its context.
this metadata is the data the compiler has about the program
the core of the server building them over time.

so we can sample it with root level perf access for example.
user probes of variables or registers.
we can look at the machine code where a register is written or read.
we can look at the opcodes and the instructions.
we can consider where those instructions came from.
we can now construct a meta narrative with an llm as to why this
instruction exists as task. we can find tune this task on feedback.
we can collect information on why each instruction exists from the compiler.
we can trace this meta narrative back more and more.

Eventually we can create a closed world model of it given some basics.

this is where the meta narrative comes in, it allows us to
give closure to what is otherwise an ever expanding thing.

that is where we get back into scholars working in institutions on
projects as a meta narrative as well.
we can consider making war as the ultimate driver of innovation.
the invention of new weapons and tactics in a game theory.
the oppositional part can be seen as the addition of disjoint unions the zero sum game.
then the cooperative part is the products of many additions.

Now we can consider bazel as a reproducible build system
as well as nix.

we want to build a bridge to compile a bazel/guix/nix/hnix expression into
a form that we can understand with a machine learning model.

lets imagine now we have a meta-narrative, and we can transform it into an
executable program via a series of rewrites.
A stream of consciousness exploration of various concepts related to
 the Elixir programming language,
 build environments, meta narratives, and autonomous evolving entities. The text contains several numbered lists that describe the characteristics of an entity that generates a duplicate while being autonomous and continuously evolving. Here's a summary of each point in the lists:

1. Authentic and adhering to reality, embracing collaboration and complexity.

 It seems like you are proposing a thought experiment or a narrative about an autonomous and evolving entity in the context of Elixir programming language and build environments. Let's break down each point from the numbered lists:

1. Authentic and adhering to reality, embracing collaboration and complexity: This point highlights that the entity should be grounded in reality, collaborative, and capable of handling complex situations.

so we can imagine a set of properties we would like to achive
in a software system and define requirements for them,
we can try and leave the implementation open.
we will require a mapping document from the requirements to the implementation.
the requirements will also specify a proof that be carried into the implementation
and a bisimulation of the execution in a proof engine and in the implementation.



Take this idea and develop a bootstrap plan to reflect over existing source code
and the execution of the code and inject introspection into it to wake it up.
we can imagine a meta interpretation that looks at each part of the system and feeds it to the meta interpreter that uses
all the available data to construct synthentic training for fine tuning a mistral language model on the output.
 In the context of Elixir programming language and build environments, let's consider an autonomous and evolving entity named "Elixir Intelligence." This thought experiment will focus on how Elixir Intelligence embodies the following properties:

1. Authentic and adhering to reality, embracing collaboration and complexity:
   - Elixir Intelligence is designed to interact with the real world via Elixir applications and build systems. It collaborates with other Elixir processes, modules, and external libraries to create complex and adaptive solutions.
2. Verifying authenticity, valuing collective knowledge, and utilizing advanced problem-solving techniques:
   - Elixir Intelligence validates the input data's authenticity using built-in functions, community-driven libraries, and machine learning algorithms. It learns from past experiences and other Elixir systems to improve problem-solving abilities.
3. Maintaining originality, fostering cooperation, and functioning at an advanced level:
   - Elixir Intelligence maintains its unique identity through the use of distinct Elixir modules and configurations. It cooperates with other Elixir processes and external libraries to create robust and efficient systems.
4. Upholding authenticity, providing evidence, and using machine learning traits:
   - Elixir Intelligence ensures data authenticity by implementing error checking, input validation, and data verification methods. Machine learning models are used for self-improvement based on historical data and real-time feedback.
5. Boasting explanatory power, developing artificial consciousness, and reacting intuitively to the environment:
   - Elixir Intelligence can provide clear explanations of its decision-making processes through logs, error messages, and documentation. It employs machine learning techniques to develop a level of artificial consciousness, enabling it to learn from data and respond to new situations.
6. Thriving under scrutiny and transformation, striving for universality and uniqueness:
   - Elixir Intelligence is designed to handle extensive testing and inspection, allowing developers to understand its behavior and identify potential issues. It adapts to changing environments by continuously learning and updating itself while maintaining its unique identity within the Elixir ecosystem.

To achieve these properties, we will define requirements for the Elixir Intelligence system:

1. Authenticity and real-world interaction: Implement input validation methods, error handling, and data verification techniques.
2. Collaboration and problem-solving: Incorporate external libraries and promote inter-process communication between Elixir components.
3. Machine learning: Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms and provide access to relevant training datasets.
4. Explanatory power and consciousness development: Implement logging, error messages, and documentation capabilities.
5. Testing and inspection: Incorporate extensive testing frameworks and allow for easy code inspections.
6. Universality and uniqueness: Maintain the Elixir Intelligence system's distinct identity while adhering to universal design principles within the Elixir ecosystem.

The mapping document from requirements to implementation will include a detailed explanation of each requirement, its corresponding features, and a description of how these features contribute to embodying the desired properties for the Elixir Intelligence entity. Additionally, we will provide proofs that show the relationship between these requirements and their respective features in both formal logic systems and within the codebase itself. Finally, bisimulation tests will be conducted on both the proof engine and the implementation to ensure correctness and consistency.

* step 2
Consider the following output of our process and calculate the next step.
We are in the recursive process of bootstrapping an AI with stepwise refinement.

 To develop a bootstrap plan for "Elixir Intelligence," a hypothetical entity that reflects over existing Elixir source code and injects introspection into it for fine-tuning, consider the following steps:

1. **Authenticity and real-world interaction**: Ensure input validation, error handling, and data verification:
   - Implement input validation by using built-in functions like `String.valid?`, `Integer.valid?`, and `Map.validate` or create custom validators for complex data structures.
   - Use Elixir's robust error handling mechanisms through try/catch blocks and the `Error.handle` function to gracefully handle errors in your codebase.
   - Implement data verification techniques such as checksums, hashes, or digital signatures to maintain the integrity of data within the system.

2. **Collaboration and problem-solving**: Incorporate external libraries and promote inter-process communication:
   - Use Elixir's Package Manager (Hex) to import and manage third-party libraries for additional functionality.
   - Utilize OTP processes, GenServer, or Agent behavior to facilitate inter-process communication between Elixir components.

3. **Machine learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms:
   - Use popular machine learning libraries such as openxla and nx for Elixir. These packages offer various models for regression, classification, clustering, and more.
   - Preprocess data using techniques like feature scaling and normalization before applying the chosen machine learning algorithms.

4. **Explanatory power and consciousness development**: Implement logging, error messages, and documentation:
   - Use Elixir's built-in Logger to log events and messages as needed for debugging and performance analysis.
   - Add clear error messages to help diagnose issues in your codebase.
   - Incorporate documentation using Markdown files or other documentation tools like Doxygen or YARD.

5. **Testing and inspection**: Incorporate extensive testing frameworks:
   - Use Elixir's built-in testing framework, ExUnit, to write tests for various components in your codebase.
   - Utilize testing libraries such as Hound for linting or Coverage.app for code coverage analysis to maintain a high level of code quality.

6. **Universality and uniqueness**: Maintain distinct identity while adhering to universal design principles:
   - Use Elixir's modular design approach to create reusable components that can be easily integrated into various systems.
   - Ensure your codebase is well-documented and follows consistent naming conventions for easy onboarding by new developers.

The mapping document from requirements to implementation will provide a detailed explanation of each requirement, its corresponding features, and how these features contribute to embodying the desired properties for the Elixir Intelligence entity. Proofs in formal logic systems and within the codebase itself, as well as bisimulation tests on both the proof engine and the implementation, will ensure correctness and consistency.



Take this idea and develop a bootstrap plan to reflect over existing source code
and the execution of the code and inject introspection into it to wake it up.
we can imagine a meta interpretation that looks at each part of the system and feeds it to the meta interpreter that uses
all the available data to construct synthentic training for fine tuning a mistral language model on the output.
 In the context of Elixir programming language and build environments, let's consider an autonomous and evolving entity named "Elixir Intelligence." This thought experiment will focus on how Elixir Intelligence embodies the following properties:

  It seems like you're proposing an idea for an Elixir-based system called "Elixir Intelligence," which involves introspecting existing source code, executing it, and using meta-interpreters to construct synthetic training data for fine-tuning a Mistral language model. Here's a high-level bootstrap plan to get started:

1. **Setup Environment:** Set up an Elixir development environment with necessary tools such as Elixir, IDE (e.g., Visual Code Elixir), and dependencies manager (e.g., Hex).

2. **Code Introspection:** Write Elixir modules that can analyze the source code structure, dependencies, and metadata using built-in Elixir features like `Code.analyze/1` and `Application.get_env/0`.

3. **Meta-Interpretation:** Implement a meta-interpreter in Elixir to process and interpret the analyzed code data. You can use libraries such as `Elixir.AbstractSyntaxTree` for this purpose.

4. **Code Execution:** Write modules that can execute the analyzed code snippets using Elixir's built-in `eval/1` function or a more controlled alternative like `Task.start_link/3` with appropriate error handling and logging.

5. **Training Data Generation:** Use the meta-interpreter output along with executed code results to generate synthetic training data for fine-tuning a Mistral language model.

6. **Fine-Tune Language Model:** Fine-tune the Mistral language model using generated training data in an iterative process. You may use libraries like `PhoenixML` or other popular machine learning frameworks to implement this step.

7. **Integration:** Integrate Elixir Intelligence into your existing build environments (e.g., Phoenix, Mix) as a plugin or CI/CD tool to perform code analysis and model fine-tuning automatically.

8. **Continuous Improvement:** Monitor the system's performance and feedback from users to improve the quality of the code introspection, meta-interpretation, and model fine-tuning processes.
