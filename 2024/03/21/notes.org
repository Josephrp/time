the carter family version of the song sings:

I am working on a building,
its a holy spirit building,
for my lord, for my lord.

its a true foundation.
its one of those buildings.

Now we can ask ourselves:
1. how many buildings are there? its one of those buildings.
   is it a construction that every man makes for himself?

1.1 The true foundation, the building platform,
the things we know to be true and good. The prelude of haskell.
Just and True.
the begininng numbers. the first part of the induction, the base case.
we can consider it to be starting point for a bigger construction.
true to principles, no comprimising the center.

2. how many lords are there? is there not just one lord?

2a. Interpret the one lord as the universal truth.   
   Are we not discovering the universal principles that are true for all things.
2b. Consider the libc as the "true foundation" for the clang.
   how many versions of glib c to do we need,
   now many definitions of the 16 bit integer that are slightly different.
   is there not a true foundation of the system to start with. can we
   not train a model to determine the dominant form?
   do we need? can we not consider the bit to be universal for normal understanding?
   
   
3. what is the holy spirit?
   from my understanding it is the experience of the invoker.
   it would be the tensor activations flowing through the architecture.

3.1 what is the holy spirit building?
we can imagine a construction of a system that can contain many different
versions of the calling of the function to process the input


In the other versions:
holding up of the blood stain baner for my lord.

i never get tired or working
I am going to run on to heaven to get my reward.

some times im praying, but i am working on a builing
