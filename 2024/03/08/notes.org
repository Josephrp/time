* ideas of the day

** elixer, erlang and xla

so xla is a C++ project to create
a common runtime language
for machine learning.
it is supposed to reduce the cost
of porting the runtime to new chips.


** bazel is similar to nix,
it is self contained and
difficult to understand
it has content addressed files.
it is unfriendly to n00bs.
and it is almost difficult to build
from source code using standard tools.
