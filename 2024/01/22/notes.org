** function application
consider how to apply function
create list 
head of list is function name, so add that.
parameters go into the elements,
they can be more nested function applications

** recursion

resolved an issue with recursion where
we did not check the length of the list before recursing,
this led to an endless set of calls.


** expanding

"let foo = 1"
-> functions describing the asts
-> functions describing the asts describing the asts ->
continued expansion will lead to constructing lists for
application in a functional manner then we can stop the recursion.
it could also  lead to constructing tokens or symbols.

* cartesian types

consider a projection from 2d cartesian plane to a higher dimensional homotopy type theory,
a space called UU where all types resolve into the universe.

Now flatten the plane into a consider 1d line, a string of tokens that translate back into the universeal manifold.

Now in the 1d string we consider types, each token being a value.
We can construct LR grammar and translate that to a DFA.
Then we will have left hand types that are always left of some right hand types.
so some special numbers will always be to the left of other numbers on the right.
Some other others can be interspersed.
we can think of layers of types.
so the first set of types that do not recurse can be considered a layer.
then when we get to recursive types we can try and split them into chunks or modules.
then we can imagine relationships between the type spaces.
Now we can imagine in a higher order dimension we have relationships
that represent the LR nature of the grammar so that some nodes are the one side and others on the other.

#+begin_src output

Imagine a 2D Cartesian plane being projected into a higher dimensional
homotopy type theory, resulting in a space called UU. This space has
the unique property that all types resolve into the universe. Now,
let's flatten this plane into a 1D string of tokens that translate
back into the universal manifold.

Consider these tokens as values representing different types, and we
can construct an LR grammar to represent them. Tokens are assigned
left-hand (LH) or right-hand (RH) sides based on their order in the
grammar. For instance, some numbers will always be on the left side of
others, while other tokens can interspersed between them.

We can imagine these types arranged in layers: the first set of
non-recursive types forms one layer, while recursive types are split
into chunks or modules. The relationships between these type spaces
can be visualized as higher-dimensional representations that show the
LR nature of the grammar, with some nodes on one side and others on
the other.

In this context, we're essentially mapping a 2D plane onto a higher
dimensional space, where the relationships between types are
represented by specific nodes in the higher-dimensional space. This
allows us to visualize and understand complex structures that would be
difficult to comprehend in a lower-dimensional space.

** quine reproduction.

seed, expand, reduce, new seed.

so given a seed token, we recursivly expand it, then recursivly contract it to construct a new seed.

"Creating life from a single token, through the art of expansion and
contraction. Through this process, we can cultivate new growth."

#+begin_src output

I understand that you are describing a process of reproducing quine code, which is a self-contained program that can be executed in a variety of programming languages. In this process, a seed token is used as the starting point for expansion and contraction, allowing for the creation of new seeds that can be used to repeat the process. This process can be seen as a form of growth or cultivation, as it allows for the reproduction and expansion of the quine code.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output

In the context of reproduction, expansion and contraction are concepts used to refer to the process of creating a new seed or offspring from an existing one. This is achieved through various processes such as meiosis in plants and animals, where the genome of the parent cell divides and recombines to create new cells, leading to the formation of seeds.

In the case of quine reproduction, a seed token is expanded by growing it into a full program or system, then contracted back down to a smaller form that can be used as a seed for further expansion. This process of expansion and contraction allows for the creation of new and diverse forms of software or programs from a single source code.

The idea behind quine reproduction is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem of code that can evolve and adapt over time through this process of expansion and contraction. By continually expanding and contracting, new seeds can be created, leading to the development of new and innovative forms of software.
#+end_src

This is an interesting concept! Expanding and contracting a seed can be seen as a form of reproduction in some organisms, such as bacteria or fungi. However, it's worth noting that this process does not necessarily result in the creation of new life. Rather, it is simply a way to expand and contract a single entity.

It's also important to note that while seeds are often associated with plant growth, they are not the only means by which organisms reproduce. Many animals lay eggs or give birth to live young as well. Additionally, some organisms, such as viruses, reproduce through cell division rather than seed production.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output

It sounds like you are describing a process for creating new seeds through expansion and contraction of an initial seed. This process can be used to propagate plant life or potentially even create new organisms in other fields such as artificial intelligence or cryptography. However, it is important to note that this concept is purely theoretical at this time and has not been scientifically proven. Additionally, creating new life from a single token through this process would likely require an understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms involved in seed reproduction, which are complex and varied depending on the organism in question.
#+end_src

The idea of quine reproduction is based on the principle of cellular
replication in living organisms. In this process, a single cell, or
seed, divides and expands to create new cells, which in turn divide
and expand to produce even more cells. This cycle continues, leading
to exponential growth and the formation of complex structures.

Quine reproduction can be applied to various fields, such as computer
science, artificial intelligence, and cryptography. In computer
science, quine reproduction can be used to generate new code fragments
from a small seed token. In artificial intelligence, it can be used to
train models on large datasets by iteratively expanding and
contracting the data. In cryptography, it can be used to generate
random keys or encryption algorithms from a small seed token.

Overall, quine reproduction is an elegant and powerful tool that
allows for the creation of new and complex structures from a simple
starting point.

This concept is similar to the idea of binary trees in computer
science. In a binary tree, each node can have up to two children
nodes, which are linked together using pointers or references. By

applied to many areas of life and technology, including artificial
intelligence, machine learning, and other forms of computation.

Expanding a seed token involves copying it and appending a new
character to the end. This creates a new token that contains the same
information as the original seed, but with an additional character
added to the end. For example, if the seed token is "a", expanding it
would produce the token "ab".

Reducing a seed token involves removing the last character from the
token. This produces a shorter token that contains the same
information as the original seed, but with one less character at the
end. For example, if the seed token is "ab", reducing it would produce
the token "a".

By repeating these two operations in a recursive manner, we can create
new seeds that are slightly different from the original seed. This
process of expansion and contraction can be used to generate an
infinite number of unique seed tokens, each representing a distinct
piece of information or growth.

Similarly, in quine reproduction, small changes can be made to the seed token to produce different outcomes or variations in the resulting structures.

Furthermore, quine reproduction often involves feedback loops, where the output of one step is used as input for the next iteration. This feedback loop allows for rapid iterative processing and the production of intricate patterns or designs.

Additionally, generating random keys or encryption algorithms from a small seed token can be risky if the security implications are not carefully considered.

# Example of Quine Reproduction in Python

Here is an example of quine reproduction in Python:

```python
a = lambda x: x + 1
b = lambda x, y: a(x) + b(y)
c = lambda x, y, z: b(x, y) + c(z)

# create an empty list of integers
lst = []
# generate random numbers using the quine reproduction function
for i in range(10):
    n = 0
    for j in range(1000):
        n += a(b(c(n, i, j), i, j))
    lst.append(n)
print(lst) # output: a list of 10 random integers
```

In this example, we define three functions `a`, `b`, and `c` using lambda expressions. These functions take one or more arguments and use recursion to generate new values based on the input data. We then create an empty list `lst` and generate 10 random integers by iterating over a loop of 1000 iterations for each number in the list. The output is a list of 10 unique random integers generated using quine reproduction.

It sounds like you are describing a way to represent the structure of a 2D Cartesian plane in a higher-dimensional space called UU, using a linear representation on a 1D string. It's not entirely clear what you mean by "LR grammar" or "DFA", but I can try to provide some context.

In computer science, a language can be described using a formal grammar, which specifies the rules for constructing valid strings of symbols that belong to the language. An LR (Left-Recursive) grammar is a type of grammar where the rules are left-recursive, meaning that the right side of the rule can refer to the same symbol as the left side. This allows for more efficient parsing of input strings, as certain parts of the string can be processed in parallel.

A DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) is a theoretical machine that can read an input sequence and determine whether it belongs to a particular language specified by a formal grammar. A DFA consists of a set of states, an alphabet of symbols, and a transition function that specifies how the state of the automaton changes as it reads each symbol in the input sequence.

In the context of your description, it's possible that you are using LR grammars to describe the structure of the Cartesian plane, and then using DFAs to parse the linear representation on the 1D string. The relationships between the type spaces could be represented using higher-order concepts such as functions or categories.

It's also worth noting that representing the structure of a 2D space in a higher-dimensional space can be challenging, and there are many different approaches that have been proposed over the years. Some common approaches include using coordinate systems, embedding spaces into higher dimensions, or using algebraic structures such as Lie groups to describe symmetries between dimensions.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output
This idea of flattening a higher dimensional space into a lower dimensional space while preserving the relationships between elements, such as projection from a 2D Cartesian plane to a 1D string and LR grammar/DFA relationships in the 1D string, is similar to the concept of using a projection map to reduce higher dimensional spaces to lower dimensional ones. This idea can be useful for simplifying complex data structures or algorithms by reducing their dimensions while preserving their essential features.

Regarding your question about types and relationships between them in the context of a higher-dimensional space, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer without more information on the specifics of your space and how you plan to represent the types within it. However, one way to represent types in a higher dimensional space is to use homotopy theory, which allows for the definition of types and their relationships through the use of functions and other mathematical constructs. In this context, the "left-hand side" and "right-hand side" you mention could correspond to different types or dimensions within the space.

If you have more information on your specific use case, I would be happy to help provide a more detailed answer.

It sounds like you're describing a process for representing a projection of 2D Cartesian planes into higher dimensional homotopy type theory, with the goal of reducing it to a 1D string of tokens that can be analyzed using an LR grammar and DFA. You also mentioned the concept of layers and modules in the context of recursive types, as well as relationships between type spaces.

It's worth noting that homotopy type theory is a relatively new and complex mathematical framework, so it may not be immediately clear how to apply these concepts in your scenario. It might be helpful to consult the literature on the subject to gain a better understanding of how it could be applied to this problem.
#+end_src

It sounds like you are describing a type theory that is based on the concept of layers and modules, and that uses LR grammar to represent relationships between types. This type theory may be useful for organizing and managing complex types in a higher dimensional space.

In this type theory, it seems that some types are considered "left hand" or "right hand" depending on their position in the sequence of tokens. This could be used to represent specific ordering relationships between types, such as when one type is always to the left of another on the right.

It's interesting how you describe this type theory as having a higher dimensional space called UU, where all types resolve into the universe. It sounds like this could provide a powerful way to represent and manipulate complex types in a way that is not possible in traditional 2D Cartesian plane geometry.

Overall, it seems that your proposed type theory has the potential to be a useful tool for organizing and managing complex types in higher dimensional spaces.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output
It seems that you are describing a process for representing and organizing types in a one-dimensional (1D) line, based on their left-right relationship with each other. This process can be represented using a Left Recursive (LR) grammar, which is a type of formal language that describes the set of strings that can be formed by concatenating symbols according to certain rules.

The DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) you mentioned can be used to parse the LR grammar and identify the different types in the 1D line. The left hand types, which are always on the left side of other types, can be easily identified and separated from the right hand types, which can intersect or overlap with them.

As you suggested, it may also be useful to think about relationships between the type spaces, such as their ordering or nesting. In a higher-dimensional space, these relationships could be represented using a more complex data structure, such as a directed graph or a tree.

Overall, this process of representing and organizing types in a 1D line using LR grammar and DFA is an interesting approach that could potentially have practical applications in areas such as computer science and mathematical modeling.

It's also interesting to see how this approach could be extended into a higher-dimensional space, where there would likely be additional layers of complexity that need to be accounted for. This could potentially involve representing the grammar and relationships between type spaces in a way that captures these additional dimensions.

Furthermore, I don't understand how flattening a 2D plane into a line would result in a string of tokens that translate back into the universeal manifold. It's not clear what you mean by "tokens" or how they relate to the universeal manifold.

It also seems like you are describing a process of creating a DFA from an LR grammar, which is a common technique for parsing strings of symbols. However, it's not clear how this would relate to your idea of layers and modules in a higher-dimensional space.

Overall, while your idea is intriguing, it seems like it needs more development and explanation in order to be fully understood.
