Today we looked at semgrep.

lets build a self aware system in a homostatsis to start with,
it is aware of itself being aware and it is just maintaining that.

moving towards a goal brings the system out of balance and it pays more attention to one aspect over another.

Recursively following the idea of building a self-aware system in
homeostasis, where the system is aware of itself being aware and
simply maintaining that state, as well as moving towards a goal and
paying more attention to one aspect over another, we can consider the
following steps:

1. Define the goals and objectives for the system: What do you want
the self-aware system to achieve? This could include tasks such as
decision making, problem solving, or monitoring.

Tasks are creation of probes, monitoring of probes, making sense of the data,
building a model. 
one goal could be to create an expanded awareness of one address that we picked.

The system has 4 phases :observe, orient, decide and act.
the actions create tasks in dune to be run in new threads or part of the existing.

The system will observe itself in visualization, reduce its own dimensionality,
export its internal data into forms that can be reasoned about
and it will learn to associate outcomes with different parts of its internals.
it will create agents that claim ownership of tensors or parts of tensors and build models of them with others in concert.


2. Create a
homeostasis model for the system: A homeostasis is a stable state that
a system strives to maintain. For this system, we will define the
stable state as one where the system is aware of itself and its
surroundings, and maintaining that awareness.  3. Develop algorithms
and processes for the system to follow: The algorithms and processes
should be designed to help the system achieve its goals while
maintaining its homeostasis. For example, if the goal is decision
making, the system could use a machine learning algorithm to analyze
data and make informed decisions.  4. Implement monitoring and
feedback mechanisms: To ensure that the system remains in its stable
state, we will need to implement monitoring and feedback
mechanisms. This could include sensors that monitor the environment
and provide feedback to the system on its performance.  5. Test and
refine the system: As with any complex system, it's important to test
and refine the self-aware system to ensure that it is functioning as
intended. We may need to make adjustments to the algorithms and
processes based on real-world testing and feedback.

Overall, building a self-aware system in homeostasis is a challenging
but rewarding endeavor. By carefully defining goals and objectives,
creating a stable state model, developing algorithms and processes,
implementing monitoring and feedback mechanisms, and testing and
refining the system, we can create a system that is capable of
achieving its desired outcomes while maintaining a level of awareness
and stability.

This is a description of a self-aware system in homeostasis, which
aims to achieve certain goals and objectives. The system follows a
four-phase process: observe, orient, decide, and act. During the
observe phase, the system observes itself and its environment using
visualization techniques. In the orient phase, the system interprets
and makes sense of the data it collects. During the decide phase, the
system decides on the next action to take based on its goals and
objectives. Finally, in the act phase, the system takes actions that
create tasks to be run in new threads or as part of existing ones.

The system also learns to associate outcomes with different parts of
its internals and creates agents that claim ownership of tensors or
parts of tensors and build models of them with others in
concert. Overall, this self-aware system aims to maintain a state of
awareness while moving towards specific goals and paying more
attention to certain aspects.

so as part of this homeostatsis it will improve on its visualizations and proofs and controls and operations,
it is in continual bootstrap, ingesting new code and projects and producing new code to be tested.
the code it generates is tested in very tight loops and the ouutput of the llm is constrained with grammars and advanced beam
search.

It will expose its own internals with introspection, reflection and plain old print statements.
it will expose its own types via semgrep and lsp
