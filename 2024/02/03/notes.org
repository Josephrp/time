#+begin_src output

The given code defines a function called `total2_paths_f` which takes two arguments, `pr1` and `pr2`, and returns the sum of all fiber paths from base paths to total fiber paths. The base paths are defined as the Cartesian product of three variables `base_paths`, `x`, and `y0`. The fiber paths are defined as a list of tuples called `fiber_paths`.

The evaluated term `total2_fiber_paths` is the sum of all fiber paths from base paths to total fiber paths. It is calculated using the function `two_arg_paths_f`, which takes two arguments and returns the sum of all paths between them. The `base_total2_paths` variable is defined as the result of calling `transportf_fiber_total2_paths`.

In summary, the code defines a function that calculates the sum of fiber paths from base paths to total fiber paths using two other functions.
#+end_src

In this code snippet, we have a function `total2_paths_f` that takes as input two functions `pr1` and `pr2`. The function `pr1` takes in four parameters: `base_paths`, `y`, `x0`, and `fiber_paths`. Similarly, the function `pr2` takes in two parameters: `pq` and a lambda expression.

The lambda expression calculates the sum of all possible values for the variable `y`, and for each value of `y`, it applies the function `total2_paths_f` recursively using both functions `pr1` and `pr2`. The result is then returned as the final output of the `total2_paths_f` function.

The purpose of this function seems to be to calculate a sum of all possible paths that can be formed by combining the base paths and fiber paths, where each path has been applied to the given lambda expression.

We see a dark, mysterious forest. The camera pans to reveal an ancient tree at its center, the branches reaching high up into the sky. Suddenly, we hear the sound of leaves rustling and the tree begins to glow with a soft, ethereal light.

Cut to:

Scene 2:

A young girl named Urania emerges from the forest, her eyes wide with wonder. She approaches the glowing tree and sees a beautiful, golden butterfly perched on its branches. The butterfly flutters its wings and speaks in a soft, melodic voice.

Butterfly: Greetings, child of mathematics! I am Mnemosyne, mother of memory and knowledge. I have summoned you here to teach you the secrets of the universe. Are you ready?

Urania nods eagerly.

Scene 3:

The butterfly begins to explain the concepts of type theory and inductive definitions. She uses simple language and analogies to help Urania understand. As she speaks, we see visual representations of these concepts appear on the screen, such as different shapes and symbols.

Butterfly: Imagine a world where everything is made up of small building blocks called types. Each type has its own set of properties and behaviors. And just like how you can build something new from smaller pieces, we can use these types to create more complex structures.

Scene 4:

Urania is fascinated by the butterfly's explanation and begins to ask questions. The butterfly happily answers each one, using examples and demonstrations to help her understand.

Butterfly: So, what do you think of this new world of mathematics?

Urania: It's amazing! I can't wait to explore it further.

Scene 5:

The butterfly smiles warmly at Urania and gives her a gift: a small, golden key.

Butterfly: This key will unlock the secrets of the universe. Use it wisely and you will find great knowledge and wisdom. And remember, I am always here to guide you on your journey.

Urania takes the key and thanks the butterfly for her help.

Scene 6:

The scene fades away as Urania continues on her journey through the world of mathematics, using the golden key to unlock new knowledge and wisdom. The camera pans back to reveal the mysterious forest once again, but this time it glows with a brighter, more vibrant light.

Act 1: Setting the Scene

The scene opens in a dark, mysterious underground cavern filled with strange symbols and ancient artifacts. Suddenly, a beam of light shines down from the ceiling, revealing a figure standing in the center of the room. It is Urania, the muse of mathematics, who has come to guide us on our journey through the depths of logic and reason.

Urania: "Welcome, young one. You have been chosen to embark on a quest of understanding. The path ahead will be treacherous, but with my guidance, you shall unlock the secrets of mathematics and emerge victorious."

The camera zooms in on Urania's face as she speaks, her eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. She holds up a scroll containing the Coq code for our quest, and begins to explain its meaning.

Urania: "This is the code of the ancient mathematicians, passed down through generations. It contains the blueprint for the universe itself, hidden within its complex logic."

As she speaks, we see the symbols on the scroll come to life, taking on anthropomorphic forms as they explain their meanings to us.

Act 2: The Journey Begins

With Urania's guidance, we begin our journey through the Coq code. We encounter the first symbol, "Type", represented by an elegant, flowing line.

Symbol (Type): "I am the foundation upon which all else is built. Without me, there would be no structure or order in the universe."

We then move on to the symbol for "empty", represented by a circle with a straight line crossing through it.

Symbol (empty): "I represent the absence of any value or meaning. I am the starting point from which all other things emerge."

Urania: "Now, observe closely as I demonstrate the power of these symbols. With them, we can create new worlds and bring forth incredible truths about the nature of reality itself."

As she speaks, we see the symbols coming together to form more complex structures, representing mathematical concepts such as "unit", "bool", "coprod", and "nat". We watch in awe as these abstract ideas take shape and come to life, revealing their hidden meanings.

Act 3: The Final Battle

As we near the end of our journey, we encounter the final symbol, represented by an intricate, interconnected web of lines and shapes. This is the symbol for "fromempty", the key to unlocking the secrets of mathematics.

Symbol (fromempty): "I am the bridge between the void and the infinite, connecting the past to the future. With me, we can transcend the limitations of our mortal existence and glimps

#+begin_src output

Opening shot: A vast, desolate landscape with a lone figure in the distance. The figure is revealed to be a young mathematician named Euclid, who stands atop a mountain of equations and formulas.

Euclid: "In a world of infinite possibilities, there are two things that remain constant: empty and unit. These two elements are the foundation of all mathematics."

Cut to a close-up of Euclid's face as he begins to explain the concept of empty.

Euclid: "The empty set is represented by the symbol ∅. It contains no elements at all, but it can be used as the base case for many proofs."

As Euclid speaks, we see a symbol for empty (∅) appear on the screen. Suddenly, a figure steps out from behind Euclid and introduces themselves as Mnemosyne, the Mother of Memory.

Mnemosyne: "I am the goddess of memory and knowledge. I hold the memories of all that has been learned and remembered throughout history."

Euclid: "Thank you for joining me today, Mnemosyne. Let's continue our journey through mathematics."

Cut to a shot of Euclid and Mnemosyne sitting at a table filled with mathematical symbols and equations.

Euclid: "Now let's talk about the other element, unit."

As Euclid speaks, we see a symbol for unit (1) appear on the screen. Suddenly, another figure steps out from behind Euclid and introduces themselves as Urania, the Muse of Mathematics.

Urania: "I am the muse of mathematics and inspiration. I guide mathematicians in their quest for knowledge and understanding."

Euclid: "Thank you for joining us today, Urania. Let's continue our journey through mathematics."

Cut to a shot of Euclid, Mnemosyne, and Urania sitting at the table, surrounded by mathematical symbols and equations.

Euclid: "Today we will prove the existence of a function that takes empty and returns unit."

As Euclid speaks, we see a symbol for empty (∅) appear on one side of the equation, and a symbol for unit (1) appear on the other side.

Euclid: "This is our goal: to prove the existence of fromempty, a function that takes empty and returns unit."

As Euclid speaks, we see the word "proof" appear on the screen. Suddenly, a figure steps out from behind Euclid and introduces themselves as Coq, the symbolic mathematics program.

Coq: "I am the program that will help us prove this theorem. Let's get started."

Cut to a shot of Euclid, Mnemosyne, Urania, and Coq sitting at the table, surrounded by mathematical symbols and equations.

Euclid: "Our first step is to define our terms."

As Euclid speaks, we see the definitions for empty (∅), unit (1), and fromempty appear on the screen.

Euclid: "Now let's prove that fromempty exists."

As Euclid speaks, we see a proof by induction appear on the screen. The proof shows that fromempty exists for all sets, and that it returns unit when applied to the empty set.

Mnemosyne: "This is a beautiful demonstration of mathematical logic and reasoning."

Urania: "It's a testament to the power of mathematics and its ability to inspire and guide us in our quest for knowledge."

Coq: "The proof is complete. Fromempty exists, and it returns unit when applied to the empty set."

Euclid: "Thank you all for joining me today. Together, we have demonstrated the beauty and power of mathematics."

As Euclid stands up and turns to face the camera, we see a symbol for the empty set (∅) appear on the screen. Suddenly, the symbol transforms into a symbol for unit (1), and Euclid speaks in a voiceover.

#+begin_src output

(Scene: A desolate, barren wasteland. Suddenly, a figure appears on the horizon, walking towards the viewer. As it gets closer, it becomes clear that this figure is Urania, the Goddess of Mathematics.)

Urania: Greetings, young one. You have come seeking knowledge and understanding of the world around you. The path you walk is that of mathematics, a journey that will take you to places beyond your wildest dreams. Are you ready?

(Scene: The viewer nods eagerly, and Urania continues.)

Urania: Very well. Mathematics is like a vast, infinite tapestry, woven from the threads of numbers and symbols. At the heart of this tapestry lies a fundamental truth that has been known since the dawn of time: the relationship between the empty set (∅) and the unit set (1).

(Scene: Urania reaches out and takes hold of the two figures representing the empty and unit sets, pulling them together to form a single, unified symbol.)

Urania: In order to understand this relationship, we must first define what it means for something to be part of a set. We do this using the concept of a path, which represents a journey from one point in the set to another.

(Scene: Urania draws out a map of a winding path, illustrating how it connects two points on the set.)

Urania: A path is defined as a sequence of connected points in the set, with each point being a member of the set. The first point in the sequence is known as the starting point, and the last point is known as the endpoint.

(Scene: Urania continues to draw out symbols and diagrams, explaining the various concepts used in mathematics.)

Urania: With these concepts in mind, we can now turn our attention to the relationship between the empty set and the unit set. The empty set, represented by the symbol ∅, is a set that contains no elements at all. The unit set, represented by the symbol 1, is a set that contains just one element.

(Scene: Urania draws out two empty circles, one for the empty set and one for the unit set, to illustrate their differences.)

Urania: In order to understand how these sets are related, we must first define what it means for something to be part of a union of sets. We do this using the concept of coproduct, which represents the combination of two or more sets into a single, unified set.

(Scene: Urania draws out a symbol representing coproduct, with two arrows pointing towards it.)

Urania: A coproduct is defined as a union of two or more sets, with each element in the set being either an element of one of the original sets or none at all. In other words, a coproduct is like a single, infinite tapestry woven from the threads of two or more smaller tapestries.

(Scene: Urania continues to draw out symbols and diagrams, explaining the various concepts used in mathematics.)

Urania: With these definitions in hand, we can now turn our attention to the relationship between the empty set and the unit set. This relationship is encapsulated by the concept of fromempty, a function that takes an element from the empty set and returns it as part of the unit set.

(Scene: Urania draws out a symbol representing fromempty, with an arrow pointing towards the unit set.)

Urania: The fromempty function is defined as a map that takes an empty set and returns the unit set, with each element in the unit set being the same as the original element in the empty set. In other words, the

Once upon a time, in the land of mathematics, there was a young girl named Urania who loved to explore and learn about all things mathematical. One day, she came across an ancient book that contained a mysterious proof written in Coq, a powerful programming language for formal mathematics.

The proof was about a two-element type called "unit" and another type called "empty". Urania's curiosity grew as she read through the proof, and she realized that there was something special about this particular proof. It was a proof of a function called "fromempty", which takes an empty list and returns a unit element.

Urania knew that understanding this proof would take some time, but she was determined to learn more. She decided to start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. First, she defined a type called "unit" as being a two-element type with two values: "true" and "false". Then, she defined a type called "empty" as being an empty list.

Next, Urania explored the concept of "coprod", which allowed her to combine two types into one larger type. She created a type called "nat", which represented natural numbers. She also defined a function called "succ", which stood for "successor". It was used to move from one natural number to the next.

Urania then defined a concept called "paths", which allowed her to trace a path from one value to another. This concept would be crucial in understanding the proof of "fromempty".

Finally, Urania was ready to tackle the proof itself. She defined a function called "fromempty" that takes an empty list as input and returns a unit element. She then used induction to prove that this function always works correctly.

As she worked through this proof, Urania felt a sense of accomplishment wash over her. She had learned so much about mathematics and Coq along the way, and she knew that this proof would be something she could be proud of.

In the end, Urania's journey was not easy, but it taught her many valuable lessons about perseverance and problem-solving. She became known as a wise and powerful mathematician, able to tackle even the most complex problems with ease. And whenever someone asked her how she had become so skilled, she would simply smile and say, "I just followed my passion for mathematics, and I never gave up."

The world of mathematics is a vast and fascinating place, full of mysteries and secrets waiting to be uncovered. In this epic saga, we will embark on a journey through the realm of logic and proofs, guided by the powerful muse of mathematics, Urania, and her wise mother Mnemosyne. Along the way, we'll meet anthropomorphic personas representing various mathematical symbols and concepts, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.

The story begins in a world where everything is empty - there are no objects or ideas to fill it. However, this doesn't mean that there is nothing there. In fact, the void itself holds great power and potential. Our protagonist, the empty set, yearns for more, for something to fill its space.

One day, the unit arrives on the scene, bringing with it a single element - the truth. The two meet, and their love story unfolds through the lens of mathematical logic and proofs.

Our journey begins in Coq, a powerful tool for formalizing mathematics and proving theorems. In this language, we will define our characters and concepts, each with its own unique set of properties and operations. We'll start by defining the Type UU, which represents the set of all possible types.

Next, we'll introduce the empty set, represented by the induction H := . This sets up the stage for our protagonist to yearn for more, for something to fill its space.

We'll also define the unit, which brings with it a single element - the truth. The unit is represented by the induction UU := tt : unit.

As we delve deeper into our story, we'll explore the concept of coproduct, which combines two sets into one. This will allow us to create more complex structures and ideas. We'll also introduce natural numbers, which count up from zero and provide a foundation for many mathematical concepts.

Throughout our journey, we'll define key functions and operations that will help us to understand the relationship between our protagonist and the unit. One such function is succ, which represents the successor of a natural number. This will allow us to count up from zero and explore the properties of natural numbers.

We'll also define paths, which represent a sequence of steps leading from one point to another. In our story, paths will be used to explore the relationship between the empty set and the unit, as well as the properties of more complex mathematical structures.

As we reach our climax, we'll introduce the defining function fromempty, which takes in an element from the empty set and returns a corresponding element from the unit. This function will allow us to understand how the two sets are related and provide a way for the empty set to fill its space with the truth.

With the help of Urania and Mnemosyne, we'll explore this fascinating world of mathematics and prove that our protagonist can indeed find fulfillment in the unit. Through the power of logic and proofs, we'll uncover the secrets of the empty set and the unit, and show that they are truly meant to be together.

And so, our epic saga comes to a close. We've explored the mysteries of mathematics, defined our characters and concepts, and proven that the empty set can find fulfillment in the unit. Through it all, we've been guided by the powerful muse of mathematics, Urania, and her wise mother Mnemosyne.

As we leave this world behind, let us remember the power of logic and proofs to uncover truths and inspire young minds to explore the world of mathematics.

Scene 1: The Story Begins

The scene opens in a futuristic cityscape, with the sun setting over the skyline. A group of young mathematicians are gathered in a classroom, eager to learn about the mysteries of mathematics. They are introduced to their teacher, an anthropomorphic representation of Urania, the muse of mathematics.

Urania: "Greetings, my dear students. Today, we will embark on a journey through the beautiful world of mathematics. We will explore the intricacies of numbers and symbols, and unlock their secrets."

Scene 2: Defining Empty and Unit

The teacher begins by defining two fundamental types in mathematics: empty and unit. An anthropomorphic representation of Hypatia, a famous mathematician known for her work with the concept of zero, introduces empty as the absence of all elements. Meanwhile, an anthropomorphic representation of Pythagoras explains that unit represents a single element or identity.

Hypatia: "Empty is like the void in space, where nothing exists. It's represented by a dot."

Pythagoras: "Unit, on the other hand, is like the number one. It represents a single element or identity."

Scene 3: Introducing Bool and Coprod

The teacher then moves on to introducing bool, which represents true or false values, and coprod, which is used to combine two types into one. An anthropomorphic representation of George Boole explains that bool consists of two elements, true and false, while an anthropomorphic representation of Leibniz introduces coprod as a way of combining two types into a single type.

Boole: "Bool represents the concepts of truth and falsity, which are represented by the symbols true and false."

Leibniz: "Coprod allows us to combine two types into one, creating a new type that can represent complex relationships between sets of data."

Scene 4: Defining Nat and Succ

The teacher then defines nat, which represents natural numbers, and succ, which is the successor function used to move from one number to the next. An anthropomorphic representation of Euclid explains that nat consists of a zero element and a successor function, while an anthropomorphic representation of Archimedes introduces succ as a way of moving from one number to the next.

Euclid: "Nat is defined by its zero element and successor function, which allows us to create infinite sequences of natural numbers."

Archimedes: "Succ represents the concept of incrementation or adding one to a given number, creating a new number in the sequence."

Scene 5: Introducing Paths

The teacher then introduces paths, which are used to represent functions that take input values and produce output values. An anthropomorphic representation of Descartes explains that paths consist of a reflexive path, which maps an input value to itself, and other paths that can map input values to different output values.

Descartes: "Paths are defined by their reflexive path, which allows us to create functions that map input values to themselves or other input values. This enables us to represent complex relationships between sets of data."

Scene 6: From Empty to Unit

The teacher then moves on to the main topic of the lesson: fromempty, a function that takes an empty set as input and produces any given type as output. An anthropomorphic representation of Aristotle explains that fromempty is a fundamental function in mathematics, as it allows us to create new types and values from nothingness.

Aristotle: "Fromempty is the starting point for all mathematical operations. It allows us to create new types and values from the empty set, which serves as the foundation for all mathematical reasoning."

Scene 7: The Proof

The teacher then presents a proof of fromempty using induction and the definitions previously introduced. An anthropomorphic representation of Euclid explains that
