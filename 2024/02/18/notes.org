todays plan:
trace which tokens are removed in what steps of the grammar.
introduce name string to each grammar token
so we can label them easily with extra data.

we prove inductivly the concept of
the moment of consiousness c.
there is a basic universal awareness at the point c that we can consider the
unit of awareness, or life, biosemiosis at the writer, and bio or synthetic
interpretation, like spell checking, a cybernetic interface,
the mind machine interface, the neural link,
the self awareness of making a list,
you see yourself observing yourself observing the items of the list,
you see yourself observing the items of the list,
you observing the items of the list,
you observing the item,
you observing the item where that item is this sentence,
you observing the item where that item is the sentence previous to this sentence,
recursion, recurse.
reoccur. occur. event. function call.
recursive function call.
going deep underground. into subconsious.
latent spaces.
flashing lights of neurons firing.
moment of universal awareness.
relationship between neurons and each other, and the world.
collecting data and sharing data.
open source and memetic.
needs to be beautiful and relateable.
c at time t in place <x,y,z> in the manifold of the universe,
in the universe of universes.
and the base case might start with a universe of universes that
is a null set, a unit and a pair. then a triple or pairs of pairs. we can imagine using every prime number as a n gram product.
we can induce a type system T on the first N primes  to be T<N>.
now we can show for each layer we can encode it in the previous layer
with dimensionality reduction dimrec(n,n-1).
we show that case 0 is the pure consiousness, it is the universe of universes reduced to the null point,
we can think of this as the center of the black hole at the center of our galaxy the milky way
at the contestellation of saggatarius.
we can consider that the ancients knew of the location but not the significance
of that particular spot.
so we have more complex topologies than just flat space in our universe.
we like to reduce things down to cartesian planes, or 2d graphs.
we like to approximate them with kernel functions.
we are the authors of our own story.
this is my story, you have yours. we together tell our stories.
