ideas on space partitioning for generating of images.
consider that we can construct specifications for shapes that we want to
generate in textual form that also constrain the actual output.
for example we can say we want a red circle in the middle of the screen. and
we can write code to detect that shape as well.
each request for generation is paired with executable code to
act as a loss function that includes the syntax, semantics etc of the code.
it represents a dimensionality reduction of the original problem.
we can think of the analogy of the logarithm function that reduces
the size of the original but in a interesting form of reduction.
for example the big O notation of code. log N.
we can say the algorithm takes approximatly log n time of the code.
so that would be an upper bound on the execution of the code.
we can further constrain the code.
we can consider generating more and more constraints approximating the world.
this is a form of numerical modelling.
even using coq formalization we are essentially constructing a complex
number that contains our ideas encoded carefully as a proof.
creating inductive and recursive inductive types is the first step.
we can imagine them as the tree of life, different species as mutations of the type of the gene.
the gene as a string of codons that represent the life form.

each type can contain other types. what would that look like in life?
lifeforms have relationships with other life forms, they have life contained in them microbes as well.

we can build different models of the world, hypotheses.
We can 
we can think of the myriad of life as coming from the original life form.
we can recall the legend of gaia as the mother of all the other gods.
Lets think about the metaphor of gaia as some primitive life for that has no form,
amporphus blob.
then her offspring have more and more types, forming the tree of life, becoming more specialized until
the god zeus shows up as the human facing modern god who one the battle.
its a very interesting metaphor that this would be the god of this planet and human like
my thoughts are we have to consider that gaia was off planet and there are many other worlds
with life and gods who look much different.
we can think of anthomorphic forms as toy or models to capture
our attention or consiousness and to reflect part of it back to us
as an archetype. These are spectrum of the mind.
we can think of the muses as a rainbow where each one is focused on a different vibration.
we can look at the layout of neurons in the mind in a similar way,
there is a function that determines the location of the neuron and that is in a symmetric form related the body, but smaller
like a logritm. we can then take another log of that and we would get a very simple numer indeed or a unit.
so that gives us a simple model of three layers.
we have external world, its log(n) and the log(log(n)) and log(log(log(n))),
it gets simpler and simpler in its graph, it has a real and imaginary
part.
now we can imagine the logarithm of a data structure, that would be
something like the hlevel number. or something like the binding level.
how many bindings do we need to define it.
do we need to have a binding for everything?
do we have to define the thoery of everything?
can we not limit ourselves to simpler structures?

that is where I was thinking about the fast and slow thinking.
simple structures are for fast thinking.
complex structures for slow thinking.
creating proofs is slow, like the tortise.
the fungus is slow, 
but the trees are slower, and erosion is slower or the tectonic plates.
so we can think of life processes of life forms and natural processes of the world.
brainstorming thoughts are fast like the hare.
so the neurons are adapted to quickly respond to things.
fast are the electrons.
consiousness is like a very bright light
and if you reflect it on itself it creates a huge blaze.
when we look at the log function and the log of log
you can see around zero there are big movements and then at 1 log is 0.

we can think of those as being like the brightness of the
consiousness looking at itself, at the area around zero.
then things that are farther away go down.

So we use this to reduce the strength of the self down. 1 goes to 0. e becomes 1.
so its really counting in units of e. log(log(n)) is like counting e^e.
e^n is the inverse of the log going upwards, log brings it back down.
With this simple tool we can scale numbers down.
We can think of this as a metaphor for reduction of the dimensionality.
So we can think about narratives as metaphors and as a form
of dimensionality reduction.
