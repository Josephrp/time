* idea of the day
we can represent the generated code of an llm with UU of uni-math,
as in the universe of universes,
that means the expressive power of the UU also applies to the unconstrained llm output.
via grammars we can constrain the output to the empty set,
the true and false, the bit and with that construct all other items.
effectively undecidable without the grammar, with the grammar it is decidable
if the grammar itself is decidable.
the grammars themselves also have semantics beyond the rules,
for referential integrity, meaning spellchecking,
semantics checking, type checking, and finally proof in proof engine,
and extraction of rewritten code into a new system.
