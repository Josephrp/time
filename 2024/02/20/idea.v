we can now use these object to encode bytes or any other object.
bytes are bit patterns that allow
construction of more complex things like emojis or unicode.
we can imagine a regex grammar for them.
we can construct grammars.

terminals. None, One.
non terminals (Two)

Thus the structure becomes meaning.
we have encoded non terminals into two, the total2 pair.

we can use the LLM to expand each pair
and explain its reasoning.

we can limit the language to specific terms and generate a grammar for it to fill out.

we can serialize the questions into strings.

(* In this code, we define a `generate_text` function that takes a large language model as an argument and generates text based on the given model. This function uses `sample_next` to generate the next character according to the language model's predictions. The `generate_text` function then generates each subsequent character by updating the generated text accordingly and printing it out. Finally, once the generated text is empty (i.e., the end of the text has been reached), the function returns the complete generated text. We also create a large language model instance called 'lm' using `create_large_language_model` and then call the `generate_text` function to generate the text. *)
