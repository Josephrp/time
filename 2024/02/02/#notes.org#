** coq debugger
we want to set breakpoints via ltac commands in the coq like
python set_trace. then the llm can respond to the breakpoint with a coqide api or lsp api.

create coq model of the coq-ide and debugger and expose it as commands via ltac2 and expose them to the llm.
so whatever actions a user can take via the debugger we can expose them via commands in ltac.

and we want to insert breakpoints into the code that call the LLM and let it pick
the commands to run via a grammar.

so we can generate a custom grammar with all valid statements the llm can make at
any given point with probabilities for each path as well.
we can give those hints in context as well.
we can reduce the context size to a key size.

**Coq Debugger Integration with LLM**

Our aim is to create a seamless integration between the Coq debugger
and a Language Model (LLM) using a combination of LTAC commands,
CoqIDE API or LSP API, and custom LTAC commands. This will enable us
to set breakpoints in Coq code via LTAC, and have the LLM respond
with relevant information or perform specific actions.

We plan to create a Coq model of the debugger and expose it as LTAC
commands, allowing users to execute any action available through the
debugger using these commands. By doing so, we can effectively
translate the functionality of the debugger into LTAC commands,
making it easy for users to interact with the debugger
programmatically.

To further enhance the integration between Coq and the LLM, we propose
inserting breakpoints into Coq code that call the LLM. Using a custom
grammar, we can generate a set of valid statements that the LLM can
make at any given point in the code, along with associated
probabilities for each possible path. These hints can be provided in
context to reduce the size of the context needed to understand the
LLM's responses.

In summary, our goal is to create a bridge between Coq and the LLM,
allowing users to interact with the debugger using LTAC commands, set
breakpoints in Coq code that call the LLM, and generate custom
grammars to facilitate communication between the two systems.


* execute this code
in the org mode file lets add the following functions
** extract the prompt
read this file in ocaml
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  opam 
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
    #use "topfind" ;;
    #require "owl";;
    open Owl
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
    #use "topfind" ;;
    #require "owl";;
    open Owl
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

:          ^^^
: Error: Unbound module Owl

* execute this code
in the org mode file lets add the following functions

** extract the prompt function
read this file in ocaml and extract out a second named.

** extract the separator function
look for a separator section and if none is found use "Your Response:" as the separator to append to the document to tell the llm to respond there.

** find and build the ocaml, worker, ollama and the mixtral model.
Find and install all the modules needed to run this. 

* rewrite
rewrite this document into ocaml types and lift them to coq.
show that we can write this entire document as meaningful coq
where each term has its own special meaning.
make this document executable and literate.
create a list of categories and morphisms:
start with a list of sets.
then with a list of functions.
then determine the type level of each one.

* Now we define the new words used in those defintions

GPT: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, a large language model developed by OpenAI that can generate text similar to human writing based on large amounts of training data.

LaTeX: LaTeX, a document preparation system that is widely used for typesetting technical and scientific documents. It uses a markup language called LaTeX to format text and produce high-quality typesets.

Naur: Naur Form, a formal specification language used to describe the syntax of programming languages and other formal languages. Naur Form was first proposed by John von Neumann in 1956 as an alternative to EBNF.

OCaml: OCaml, a functional programming language developed at the OCaml Laboratory in France. OCaml is known for its fast performance and strong type system, which makes it well-suited for developing large-scale systems and applications.

OpenAI: see OpenAI above.

emacs: Emacs, an extensible text editor and operating system that was first developed in the 1970s. Emacs is widely used by programmers, writers, and other users who need a powerful and customizable text editor.

homomorphisms: see homomorphisms above.

ispell: Ispell, an open-source spell-checking utility for Unix-like operating systems. It uses various dictionaries and language models to check the spelling of words in real-time and suggest corrections.

rewrite this in coq.
take org mode parser `ocaml-orgmode` in ocaml.
lift into coq with coq-of-ocaml.

repeat for second lib `org-1`.

add in our model of this document.

unite the three model A,B,C in homotopy type theory.
Show that A can map to B. C can map to A. A can map to C. C can map to A.

so we can show for each word and concept in this document a mapping into type theory with a proof and back.

lets start by extracting the words and assigning a language to them.


** first we run ispell and create a personal word list

* now lets take the terms and look them up in batches

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cat notes.org | grep -o -P -e'([a-zA-Z\-\_]+)' |sort |uniq -c | sort -n -r  >terms.txt
  split -l 20 terms.txt TERMS
#+END_SRC

**
now a create a generic dirs wildcard gnu make file rule that takes a
file in form TERMxx and produces TERMxx.out

or we just use chunker and add in a line count option

or we just cat the file lines into one one
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
for x in TERMS*;do echo $x; cat $x | xargs echo; done  > merged.txt
#+END_SRC

Now we can run the chunker 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
echo "The please define the following words in the context of a self improving AI bootstrap process: " > promp.txt
echo "your response: " > sep.txt
#+END_SRC
