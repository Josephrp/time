* orfeus as actor/demigod

the orfeus character acts as a god and human, as composor and actor in his own art.
he represents the story teller who writes himself into the story.

so the idea of the introspector as the bard warrior that explains what
we are seeing in an easier to consume manner,
singing a tale of the data but also being an actor in it.

in that respect the story is about the poet and the story creates the poet, so it is autopoetic and writes itself into existance.
