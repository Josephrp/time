* comic book

we can think of this idea of translating unimath into a video or comic book
as a translation of the module of unimath into pages or chapters or series of books.
the entire unimath would be an epic amount of books to contain all the details.
so there would be a function mapping one system onto the other and back
a multi layered encoding of colors and symmetries and eigenvalues and eigenvectors
and directions and morphisms between the math and the art that it is embedded into.
we can then later embed the art back into unimath and show that there are layered representations
of the same thing.
