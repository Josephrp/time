 Result: Here is a simple Menhir grammar for describing more complex grammars:
```ocaml
%token <string> SYMBOL

%start Grammar

Grammar:
  Nonterminals ';' Productions '.' EOF

Nonterminals:
  /* empty */
| Nonterminals SymbolDef

SymbolDef:
  SYMBOL ':' Type

Type:
  /* empty */
| '{' Types '}'

Types:
  /* empty */
| Types Type

Productions:
  /* empty */
| Productions Production

Production:
  Nonterminal '::=' Expression

Nonterminal:
  SYMBOL

Expression:
  Alternatives

Alternatives:
  Expression
| Alternatives '|' Expression
```
This grammar defines a simple context-free grammar (CFG) with nonterminals, productions, and expressions. Nonterminals are defined using the `SymbolDef` production, which consists of a symbol name followed by a colon and a type. The type can be either empty or a set of types enclosed in curly braces. Productions consist of a nonterminal followed by `::=` and an expression. Expressions can be a sequence of alternatives separated by `|`.

This grammar is simple enough to be used as a starting point for describing more complex grammars, but it can also be extended with additional productions and rules to handle specific language features or constructs.
