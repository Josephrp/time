(* Function types representing actions *)

(* Top-level function type *)

(* ``` *)

(* These types capture the essential structure of the code, including: *)

(* * Basic types like `string` and `bool`. *)
(* * A custom type `package` for package information. *)
(* * `build_fhs_env_args` and `build_fhs_env_record` to represent arguments and fields of the `buildFHSEnv` function. *)
(* * Types for representing lists of strings, options, and folders. *)
(* * Function types for commands, processes, and the `build_fhs_env` function itself. *)

(* **Note:** This is a simplified representation and doesn't cover all details of the code, such as nested functions and specific string manipulations. You can further refine these types to capture more specific details if needed. *)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
(* Here's a list of Coq types that could theoretically capture the content you provided: *)

(* **1. Package:** *)

(* ``` *)
Inductive Package :=
| Pkg {
    pname: string;
    version: string;
    meta: any;  -- Replace with a more specific type if known
  }
(* ``` *)

(* **2. Script:** *)

(* ``` *)
Inductive Script :=
| RunScript {
    cmd: string;
    unshare_ipc: bool;
    unshare_user: bool;
    unshare_uts: bool;
    unshare_cgroup: bool;
    unshare_pid: bool;
    unshare_net: bool;
  }
(* ``` *)

(* **3. Dbus:** *)

(* ``` *)
Inductive Dbus :=
| Talk { service: string }
| Own { service: string }
| Call { service: string; method: string; path: string }
| Broadcast { service: string; signal: string; path: string }
(* ``` *)

(* **4. FolderPath:** *)

(* ``` *)
Inductive FolderPath :=
| FPath { path: string }
(* ``` *)

(* **5. BwrapArgs:** *)

(* ``` *)
Inductive BwrapArgs :=
| NewSession
| Tmpfs { path: string }
| Bind { src: string; dst: string }
| Setenv { var: string; value: string }
| RoBind { src: string; dst: string }
| AdditionalArgs { args: list string }
(* ``` *)

(* **6. BuildFHSEnv:** *)

(* ``` *)
Inductive BuildFHSEnv :=
| Build {
    pkg: Package;
    run_script: Script;
    name: option string;
    target_pkgs: list Package;
    extra_install_commands: string;
    extra_pre_bwrap_cmds: string;
    extra_bwrap_args: list BwrapArgs;
  }
(* ``` *)

(* These are basic types and might need further refinement based on the specific details and functionalities of the code. For instance, the `any` type in `Package.meta` could be replaced with a more specific type if the meta-data has a known structure. Additionally, you might need to define types for other elements like `appId` and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` if they are used in the code. *)

(*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This is just a starting point, and you might need to adjust and extend these types further to fully capture the complexities of the code. *)

(* Here are some Coq types that could theoretically capture the content provided in the code: *)

(* ``` *)
(* Basic types *)
Inductive package := Pkg {
  pname: string;
  version: string;
  meta: string;
}.

(* Function types *)
Definition cmd := string -> string.

Definition string_list := list string.

(* Option type *)
Inductive option A := None | Some (A).

(* Record types *)
Record build_fhs_env := {
  inherit pkg: package;
  inherit run_script: option cmd;
  
  (* other inherited fields *)
  name: option string;
  target_pkgs: list package;
  extra_install_commands: cmd;
  extra_pre_bwrap_cmds: cmd;
  extra_bwrap_args: list string;
}.

Record dbus_call := {
  service: string;
  method: string;
  path: string;
}.

Record dbus_talk := {
  service: string;
}.

Record dbus_own := {
  service: string;
}.
(* ``` *)

(* **Explanation:** *)

(* * `package`: This record type represents a software package with its name, version, and metadata. *)
(* * `cmd`: This type represents a function that takes a string and returns a string, essentially capturing the functionality of commands. *)
(* * `string_list`: This type represents a list of strings. *)
(* * `option A`: This type represents an optional value of type `A`. `None` represents the absence of a value, and `Some (a)` represents a value `a` of type `A`. *)
(* * `build_fhs_env`: This record type captures the main structure of the `buildFHSEnv` function, including inherited fields, and additional fields like `name`, `target_pkgs`, and various commands. *)
(* * `dbus_call`: This record type represents a DBus call with its service, method, and path. *)
(* * `dbus_talk`: This record type represents a DBus service that the program wants to talk to. *)
(* * `dbus_own`: This record type represents a DBus service that the program wants to own. *)

(* **Note:** *)

(* * This is a simplified representation and doesn't capture all aspects of the code. *)
(* * Additional types can be defined for specific data structures like lists of `dbus_call` or `dbus_own`. *)
(* * Further refinement and extension of these types might be necessary depending on the specific needs of formal verification.                     *)
