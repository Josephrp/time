Metaphors as features, edges.
edge spans multiple nodes so nodesets to create hyperedges.
Hypergraph learning and Deep hypergraph learning

#+begin_src bash
git submodule add https://github.com/iMoonLab/DeepHypergraph
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Edges as branches, pointers,
nodes as instruction types.

intruction bytes as input,
mask as learned model.
split between instructions and parameters.
instructions that depend on state of
other instructions become hyper edges.
calculating dependencies.
dependencies as message passing.

perf execution traces as inputs.
perf records as input.
perf code as input.
