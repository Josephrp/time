For mathematics expressed in unimath
we can think of the policy and
value network to be from unimath,
where the policy network is the construction of the calculations evolving
with llms and other tools, and 
The value network is the proof of the calculation.

expand and reduce, breath in and out.

So the policy choices can be seen as a tree search of solutions.

Now the expanded graph can be seen as a network, a knowledge graph.

Each step in the expansion and contraction can be seen as a graph transformation.
we can train a model on these transitions as well to guess the next step.

The deep knowledge graph embedding
can be seen as
1. graph partitioning and clustering on different dimensions
2. graph traversal or serialization,
   we can look for eigenvector.
3. llm inference under aspects, that creates new policies
4. policy evaluation.
