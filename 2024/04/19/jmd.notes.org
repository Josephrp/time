Now I will start using my name prefix in the notes so that we can have
multiple authors merging.

OODA,
the action can be observation.
We can think of one ooda loop simulating another.
the action step of one is the observation step of the other.
therefore they unite in one step, and one step has two different names
for the same thing. Math is a way to give different names to the same thing.

Not only can the action of observation be an action and the obseve step
but we can also observe the action taking place and have an observation
of the action of observation. These steps can be seen as the homotopy type levels
and as steps in the proof path over the abstract topological space.

now lets plan:
